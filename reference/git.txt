git add -n . (dry run is -n option)

exclude file:
.git/info/exclude

removing added files:
git rm --cached FILE (don't forget the cached!)

git workflow:

git clone http://git.something.org/project/title.git (checks out master branch)

git add FILES (use . for all, git add -n FILES for mock)
git status
git commit -m "message text" (local commit)

Make sure SSH is setup (add public key to the repo, private in local .ssh folder)

git push REPOSITORY (where REPOSITORY is either a remote URL or a name of a remote, which are specified in GIT/config, GIT/remotes, or GIT/branches)

generally we'll just want to push to origin... which is what is conventually the primary centralized repo (a github account for example)

git remote (show's what's configured as remote repos)
git remote show origin (shows more info about a particular repo ... origin in this case)
