notes
=====

A project of loosely organized markdown files containing notes on various things. The general idea is by attempting to organize and condense knowledge I will be more likely to retain it. As a git repository (combined with github), I will have an accessible and version managed repository to find it again.

For now a git repository hosted at github will have to do. However, while it meets the core needs, using the github interface isn't ideal.
